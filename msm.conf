# Minecraft Server Manager Configuration File
# ===========================================
#
# 

# User
# ----

# The user which Minecraft Server Manager commands will be executed as.
# Also used by default for starting servers who do not specify an individual
# server user.
USERNAME="minecraft"


# Directory Locations
# -------------------

# These values are very important. They define where MSM stores various files

# Where new servers are stored
SERVER_STORAGE_PATH="/opt/msm/servers"

# Where runnable jar files for use by servers are stored
JAR_STORAGE_PATH="/opt/msm/jars"


# Where RAM enambled worlds are stored
# This needs to be a path located inside the mounted ramdisk for your system
# under Ubuntu this would be "/dev/shm", so "/dev/shm/msm" would be a good
# location. If left blank RAM disk will not be used.
RAMDISK_STORAGE_PATH="/dev/shm/msm"


# Quick IMPORTANT note:
# The following three paths are used to store backups of your servers which
# MSM creates periodically. Backups are usefull if a world becomes unlayable
# and needs to be restored to an earlier point in time. Or maybe a new plugin
# for a server corrupts some files. In these cases you can restore to a
# backup from these directories.
#
# If you want protection for disk failure also, be sure to spcify paths to a 
# separate disk. This can be achieved by mounting an external hard drive, or
# a NAS and locating the following paths there.


# Where "WorldEdit snapshot" compatible world backups are stored.
WORLD_ARCHIVE_PATH="/opt/msm/archives/worlds"

# Where archived logs are stored, when a servers logs are "rolled":
LOG_ARCHIVE_PATH="/opt/msm/archives/logs"

# Where complete server backups are stored:
BACKUP_ARCHIVE_PATH="/opt/msm/archives/backups"



# Server Defaults
# ---------------

# These values are the default values used when a server does not override
# them in its individual config file.
# They are also the default values used when a new server is created, without
# specifying any arguments.

# Any settings in the Server Defaults sections ending in PATH are relative
# to the server directory. That is unless an absolute path is given (one
# starting with a forward slash '/'.)


# User which stars the server, and interacts with it
DEFAULT_USERNAME="minecraft"

# The name under which to run a servers screen session, each is made unique
# by including the {SERVER_NAME} tag.
DEFAULT_SCREEN_NAME="msm-{SERVER_NAME}"

# A directory name relative to the server directory where worlds are stored
DEFAULT_WORLD_STORAGE_PATH="worldstorage"

# A directory name relative to the server directory where old worlds are stored
# These worlds will cannot be used by the server and will not be saved when
# backing up all worlds. But will be inclued in a complete server backup.
DEFAULT_WORLD_STORAGE_INACTIVE_PATH="worldstorage_inactive"

# "true" and symlinks are followed when performing a complete backup,
# "false" and symlinks are replaced in the zip with a file containing the
# path to the original symlink larget.
# Setting this to false is useful if symlinks point to files that will
# already be included in the backup (such as world symlinks.)
DEFAULT_COMPLETE_BACKUP_FOLLOW_SYMLINKS="false"


# The location of standard Minecraft server files, relative to the
# server directory
DEFAULT_LOG_PATH="server.log"
DEFAULT_PROPERTIES_PATH="server.properties"
DEFAULT_WHITELIST_PATH="white-list.txt"
DEFAULT_BANNED_PLAYERS_PATH="banned-players.txt"
DEFAULT_BANNED_IPS_PATH="banned-ips.txt"
DEFAULT_OPS_PATH="ops.txt"

# The location of the jar file to execute, relative to the server directory
DEFAULT_JAR_PATH="server.jar"

# The amount of memory to dedicate to a server (in MB)
DEFAULT_RAM="1024"

# The command used to start the server. You may use the following tags which
# will be replaced:
# 
# {RAM} - Gets replaced with the amount of RAM specified for the server
# {JAR} - Gets replaced with the location of the jar file for the server
#
# Hard coding values here (not using {MEMORY} and {JAR} tags) will prevent
# servers from individually overriding those values.
DEFAULT_INVOCATION="java -Xms{RAM}M -Xmx{RAM}M -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC -XX:+CMSIncrementalPacing -XX:+AggressiveOpts -jar {JAR} nogui"
