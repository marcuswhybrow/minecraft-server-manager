# Minecraft Server Manager Configuration File
# ===========================================
#
# 

# User
# ----

# The user which Minecraft Server Manager commands will be executed as.
# Also used by default for starting servers who do not specify an individual
# server user.
USERNAME="minecraft"


# Directory Locations
# -------------------

# These values are very important. They define where MSM stores various files

# Where new servers are stored
SERVER_STORAGE_PATH="/opt/msm/servers"

# Where runnable jar files for use by servers are stored
JAR_STORAGE_PATH="/opt/msm/jars"

# Where versioning data is stored to help MSM accommodate all Minecraft versions
VERSIONING_STORAGE_PATH="/opt/msm/versioning"


# Change this to "true" to allow MSM to use RAMDisk for storing worlds.
# Note: RAMDisk will only be used for worlds enabled as "in ram".
RAMDISK_STORAGE_ENABLED="true"

# Where RAM enabled worlds are stored
# This needs to be a path located inside the mounted ramdisk for your system
# under Ubuntu this would be "/dev/shm", so "/dev/shm/msm" would be a good
# location. This is ignored if RAMDISK_STORAGE_ENABLED is not "true"
RAMDISK_STORAGE_PATH="/dev/shm/msm"


# Quick IMPORTANT note:
# The following three paths are used to store backups of your servers which
# MSM creates periodically. Backups are useful if a world becomes unplayable
# and needs to be restored to an earlier point in time. Or maybe a new plugin
# for a server corrupts some files. In these cases you can restore to a
# backup from these directories.
#
# If you want protection for disk failure also, be sure to specify paths to a 
# separate disk. This can be achieved by mounting an external hard drive, or
# a NAS and locating the following paths there.


# Where "WorldEdit snapshot" compatible world backups are stored.
WORLD_ARCHIVE_PATH="/opt/msm/archives/worlds"

# Where archived logs are stored, when a servers logs are "rolled":
LOG_ARCHIVE_PATH="/opt/msm/archives/logs"

# Where complete server backups are stored:
BACKUP_ARCHIVE_PATH="/opt/msm/archives/backups"

# Server properties file to be created alongside with server creation,
# relative to server directory
SERVER_PROPERTIES="server.properties"

# MSM properties file which allows default value
# to be overriden on a server basis,
# absolute path if starting with a slash
# else relative to server directory
# properties are lowercase and prefixed with "msm-"
# Exemple :
# to override DEFAULT_RAM value for a server to 4096
# add line "msm-ram=4096" to this file
# {SERVER_NAME} tag is available
SERVER_MSM_PROPERTIES="server.properties"



# Server Defaults
# ---------------

# These values are the default values used when a server does not override
# them in its individual config file.
# They are also the default values used when a new server is created, without
# specifying any arguments.

# Any settings in the Server Defaults sections ending in PATH are relative
# to the server directory. That is unless an absolute path is given (one
# starting with a forward slash '/'.)


# User which stars the server, and interacts with it
DEFAULT_USERNAME="minecraft"

# The name under which to run a servers screen session, each is made unique
# by including the {SERVER_NAME} tag.
DEFAULT_SCREEN_NAME="msm-{SERVER_NAME}"

# A directory name relative to the server directory where worlds are stored
DEFAULT_WORLD_STORAGE_PATH="worldstorage"

# A directory name relative to the server directory where old worlds are stored
# These worlds will cannot be used by the server and will not be saved when
# backing up all worlds. But will be included in a complete server backup.
DEFAULT_WORLD_STORAGE_INACTIVE_PATH="worldstorage_inactive"

# The default command to generate a complete server backup,
# allows you to use compression method of your choice,
# custom options (exclude directory for exemple),
# or even a complete different method, rsync for exemple
# Tags:
# {SERVER_STORAGE_PATH}	: path where are stored servers
# {SERVER_NAME}			: dirname of the server to be saved
# {BACKUP_ARCHIVE_PATH}	: path where the backup should be generated
# exemples:
# - ZIP
#	method used with previous version,
#	selected by default to avoid surprise after update
#	DEFAULT_COMPLETE_BACKUP_COMMAND="cd '{SERVER_STORAGE_PATH}' && zip -rqy '{BACKUP_ARCHIVE_PATH}/$(date "+%F-%H-%M-%S").zip' '{SERVER_NAME}'"
# - ZIP with follow symlink option
#	same as previous one, but symlinks are replaced by their targets
#	DEFAULT_COMPLETE_BACKUP_COMMAND="cd '{SERVER_STORAGE_PATH}' && zip -rq '{BACKUP_ARCHIVE_PATH}/$(date "+%F-%H-%M-%S").zip' '{SERVER_NAME}'"
# - TAR+GZ
#	allowing this configuration was the main purpose of this modification,
#	may helps you if having memory problems with zip
#	DEFAULT_COMPLETE_BACKUP_COMMAND="cd '{SERVER_STORAGE_PATH}' && tar -czf '{BACKUP_ARCHIVE_PATH}/$(date "+%F-%H-%M-%S").tar.gz' '{SERVER_NAME}'"
# - TAR+GZ with follow symlink option
#	same as previous one, but symlinks are replaced by their targets
#	DEFAULT_COMPLETE_BACKUP_COMMAND="cd '{SERVER_STORAGE_PATH}' && tar -czhf '{BACKUP_ARCHIVE_PATH}/$(date "+%F-%H-%M-%S").tar.gz' '{SERVER_NAME}'"
# - TAR+GZ with exclude caches
#	any directory containing the standard CACHEDIR.TAG won't be included in backup
#	CACHEDIR.TAG file specifications here:
#	http://www.brynosaurus.com/cachedir/spec.html
#	DEFAULT_COMPLETE_BACKUP_COMMAND="cd '{SERVER_STORAGE_PATH}' && tar -czf '{BACKUP_ARCHIVE_PATH}/$(date "+%F-%H-%M-%S").tar.gz' --exclude-caches '{SERVER_NAME}'"
DEFAULT_COMPLETE_BACKUP_COMMAND="cd '{SERVER_STORAGE_PATH}' && zip -rqy '{BACKUP_ARCHIVE_PATH}/$(date "+%F-%H-%M-%S").zip' '{SERVER_NAME}'"

# The amount of memory to dedicate to a server (in MB)
DEFAULT_RAM="1024"

# The command used to start the server. You may use the following tags which
# will be replaced:
# 
# {RAM} - Gets replaced with the amount of RAM specified for the server
# {JAR} - Gets replaced with the location of the jar file for the server
#
# Hard coding values here (not using {MEMORY} and {JAR} tags) will prevent
# servers from individually overriding those values.

# The default message sent to players on a server which was in the process of
# shutting down, but was aborted by an admin probably pressing Ctrl+C.
DEFAULT_MESSAGE_STOP_ABORT="Server shut down aborted."
